Mock Interview Prep Material
===============

TODO:
  - Collection of interview questions to be sourced from:
    * http://projecteuler.net/
    * http://codeeval.com/
    * rapleaf (or liveramp) challenge questions (e.g. "array absuridyt")
    * facebook challenges
    * https://www.hackerrank.com/
    * http://poj.org/
    * http://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm
    * Cracking the coding interview
  - Code review (with errors ranked by importance)
  - Rank by difficulty
  - Rquestion classes
    * OOP
      ^ inheritance vs composition
      ^ polymorphism
      ^ encapsulation
    * data structures
      ^ trees
      ^ graphs
      ^ sets
      ^ maps
    * algorithms
      ^ recursion
      ^ dynamic programming

What not to do
  - Use a language you don't know.
Do do
  - Focus on scale (big-O).
  - Name big-Os on all operations, on both time and space!
  - Recrusion is always at least O(log n) space! (unless tail recursive).

Questions:
  - (Open form) You are downloading two files. One reports it will be completed in 4 minutes, the other in 8. When will both be done?
    * Are both on the same server?
    * Are they using the same amount of bandwith?
    * Is the server limiting bandwith per connection, or per client?
  - Create a datastructure which supports two operations: add() to insert an integer, and test() which accepts an integer and returns True if two integers have been add()'d such that their sum is equal to the value being tested.
  - Minimize dot product (Mikel's jelly beans)
  - Create a data structure which contains integers and support constant add(), remove(), and getRandom() operations.
  - List implementation. Examples include ArrayList and LinkedList.

How to succeed:
  - Make the interviewer personally want you on their team.
  - Be nice!
  - Enthusiasm is a good thing.
  - For loops over while -- http://nedbatchelder.com/text/iter.html
