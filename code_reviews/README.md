Instructions for proctor:
  * Each question has a recommended time limit, but can be scaled down for less experienced interviewees.
  * You are to tell them that that there is at least one bug (do not give an upper bound). The programs compile and the bugs may not be noticeable to someone who did simple testing, though robust testing might find bugs.
  * Once all bugs are found they can critique design and efficiency. These are much, much lower concnerns and they should not be distracted by them.
  * Debrief afterward. Misconceptions are often revealed and should be corrected.

Recommended time limits:
  binary_search.py - 10 minutes
  List.java - 30 minutes
  List.ccp and Object.h - 40 minutes

Note that both list questions are similar enough that having done one of them, the other is significantly less useful. More and varied questions should be added instead of using the same question again. Most importantly, if someone who hasn't done an exercise sees someone else debriefed, they'll lose out on the experience they could have gained, so for the benefit of others be careful about this.
